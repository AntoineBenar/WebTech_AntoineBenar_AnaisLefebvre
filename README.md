# My feelings about this project

This project was a great way to discover all the complexity of a large-envergure project, using React, even if the setup of Dex and Docker has been pretty complicated and bugged at the begining.

For now, the "empty links" as About Us, Contact Us ... in the project redirect on the Oups page, beacause I didn't have the time to create those simple pages.

I am not fully satisfied of the advancement of the project. A lot of work and efforts have been made into it, however, it is not totally completed.

Indeed, some operations concerning the back-end and avatars don't work properly (some traces of the tries can be found in comments trough he code), as I didn't have the time to finish it. I will maybe do later this year, as it was very entertaining.

More, I unfortunatly lost a few hours of work, as my computed decided to suddently bluescreen into do some windows updates (yippy, thank you Windows)
